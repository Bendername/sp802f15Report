\section*{Terminology}\label{preface:terminology}
\textbf{Gamepad}\vspace{4pt}\\
A game input device commonly used with consoles.

\textbf{Gameplay}\vspace{4pt}\\
Throughout this report, we use Sid Meier's definition; \textit{``A series of interesting choices''}\cite{GDC2012}.

\\
\textbf{Strategy}\vspace{4pt}\\
We define the strategic aspect of a video game as \emph{a series of meaningful choices which the player/players believe will take the person/persons closer to the goal.}
The choice of this definition is argued in section \ref{sec:specifyingtheproblemstatemen}.\\
\\
\textbf{Balancing}\vspace{4pt}\\
Altering the difficulty of the game to neither be too hard, nor too easy.
The idea is to keep the player in the \textit{Flow zone}, see section \ref{makingthegamefun:cognitiveflow}.\\

\textbf{GameEngine}\vspace{4pt}\\
A Game Engine is a framework for common tasks associated with games programming.
An example of a Game Engine is Unity3D, which simplifies tasks such as rendering 3d graphics and networking.
Furthermore it has an editor that further simplifies the task of creating game worlds\cite{unityGameEngine}.\\

\\
\textbf{Collider}\vspace{4pt}\\
Colliders in Unity is a component one can attach to a Gameobject, such that a method is called when another Gameobject with a Rigidbody\cite{rigidbody} collides with it.\cite{collider2d}
A variation of these are called Trigger Colliders.
These does not collide with Rigidbodies, but instead respond to when a Rigidbody is inside the volume of the trigger collider.\cite{collider2dtrigger}\\
\\
\textbf{Raycast}\vspace{4pt}\\
Casts a ray against colliders in the game. \cite{raycast}\\
