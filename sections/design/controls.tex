\section{Gamepad Controls}
\label{sec:design:controls}

Controlling the game with a gamepad is natively supported by Unity3D, where the user can use the Input Manager \cite{unity_manual_inputmanager} and add axes that use ``Joystick Axis''. Unity allows reading 20 different axes, where buttons also count as axes.

However this not straight forward if the game is to run on different platforms, and even more difficult if the game should support different gamepads. This is because there is no standard for which axes the different thumbsticks and buttons are mapped to, and this is instead dependent on the driver software. This means that an Xbox 360 controller will be mapped differently on for example Windows, Mac, and Linux.
\cite{unity_wiki_xbox360controller}

To solve this, one could identify the gamepad and operating system and from that, determine which axes correspond to the right sticks and buttons. A plugin for Unity3D called ``InControl''\cite{incontrol_github} does this. ``InControl'' is an open source project that \begin{quote}``Standardizes controller input mappings across various platforms.''\cite{incontrol_website}\end{quote}

The open sourced version is free and available at Github, but there is also a pro version available through the Unity3d asset store\cite{incontrol_assetstore} which offers some additional features.
