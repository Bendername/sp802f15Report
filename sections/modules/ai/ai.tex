The game being challenging confines largely to item 2, but also items 5 and 6 from the requirements in section \ref{gamedesign:selectionofgametype:importantstuff}.
The challenge in the game is the horde of enemies that chase the player, but if the enemies are all stuck behind a wall the challenge is non-existent.
Therefore the enemies need to be able to avoid obstacles and chase the players in a intelligent way.
This could be achieved by applying a pathfinding algorithm to the AI's behaviour.
The process of creating an adequate pathfinding algorithm for our game was a three iteration process which involved different optimizations to the algorithm.
