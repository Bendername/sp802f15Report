\section{Networking}
Since GAME\todobenjamin{correct this when we have found a name for the game} is a multiplayer game using multiple devices, networking is required. This section will describe the implementation of the networking parts.

\subsection{Connecting to a server}
The first part of connecting to a server is knowing the ip address of the server.
Finding the ip address of a server is not a trivial.
In order for the clients to find a hosted server, that server has to broadcast its address across the whole network.
This can be done by sending packets to a broadcast address and a specified port.
The address 255.255.255.255 is the \textit{this network} broadcast address, which means its broadcasts are limited to the local network.
The server broadcasts its address, the name of the host, and the current amount of players.

When the client is in the server browser, it listens for broadcasts on the same port, and will then construct a server list from the data received.
Clicking on one of the servers will then connect the client to that server.


\subsection{Clientside prediction}
