\section{Designing a Game}
Designing a game and deciding what the goals and core mechanic should be, is often considered a task of figuring out
what is \emph{fun} in the setting of the game you're making.  If your game is \emph{fun} then it is more likely that
people will appreciate it and play it.
While the \textif{fun-factor} is certainly an important thing to consider when designing interactive media, it is also
a hard \textit{thing} to measure. But a scientific concept which we believe can have an impact on how fun an activity
is perceived by the player, and also affect their span of attention when playing our game, is that of \textit{cognitive
flow}.
