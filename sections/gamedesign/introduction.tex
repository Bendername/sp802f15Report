\section{Designing a Game}
Designing a game and deciding what the goals should be, is often considered a task of figuring out what is \emph{fun} in the setting of the game your making. 
If your game is \emph{fun}, then people will play it. 
While the fun-factor is certainly critical thing to consider, it is hard to measure.
There are, however, more scientific based concepts which we can use when designing our game.
