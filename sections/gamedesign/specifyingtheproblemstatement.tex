Our problem statement states: ``\textit{What is required to create a synchronous multiplayer game for mobile devices, which contains both advanced
gameplay and more complex strategical aspects for a mobile device?}''\\
This can be interprets in many ways therefore a specification of the keywords will be made.
The keywords from this statement are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Synchronous multiplayer
\item Mobile devices
\item Advanced gameplay
\item Complex strategical aspects
\end{itemize}
In order to achieve \textbf{synchronous multiplayer} it should be possible to have one or more devices able to be in the same game, and play together. This includes watching each other do real-time actions in the given game world.\\\\
\textbf{Mobile devices} is a very loosely defined in many different contexts, this report will follow Oxford Dictionary and define a mobile devices as: ``A portable computing device such as a smartphone or tablet computer''\cite{mobileOx}\\\\
The definition of \textit{gameplay} is differently defined in many different contexts. An example could be Oxford Dictionary that defines it as \textit{``The features of a computer game, such as its plot and the way it is played, as distinct from the graphics and sound effects.''}\cite{gameplayOx}, which very loosely defined since the features of a computer game is a very broad term. Another definition could be Sid Meier's definition: \textit{``A series of interesting choices''}\cite{GDC2012}. This definition is still vague but it is elaborated further in his speak at GDC 2012.\cite{GDC2012}
He in general uses this definition as a tool to look at the gameplay, ``A series of interesting choices'', to see if these choices the player makes are satisfying according to some criteria for the game.\\
Therefore, by following Sid Meier's definition, in order to advanced gameplay the game must contain an advanced series of interesting choices.

Making gameplay advanced and having a series of interesting choices must lead somewhere.
The choices must be made in order to achieve something, otherwise they are meaningless and cease to be interesting.
This is where the strategy keyword comes in.\\\\

\textbf{Complex Strategical Aspect}: The Oxford dictionaries define \textit{strategy} as \textit{``A plan of action designed to achieve a long-term or overall aim''}.\cite{strategyOx}
Giving the player the ability to make meaningful choices would allow for the player to create strategies to achieve its goal.
These choices should not be right or wrong choices, but choices the player can make give the person can make to give a certain advantage in different situations.
An example of this could be a talent-/skill-tree in a MMORPG, which gives the player a variety of choices in how to achieve their goal whether it is killing a boss in the game or battling other players.
As such, we define the strategic aspect of a video game as a series of meaningful choices which the player/players believe will take the person/persons closer to the goal.
