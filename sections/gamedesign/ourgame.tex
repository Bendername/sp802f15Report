%\subsection{Main game concepts}\label{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}
%Whilst obviously designing a game which is fun, it is important to us that we try to understand the concepts of cognitive flow outlined in \ref{gamedesign:cognitiveflow} such that we have a psychological scientific foundation on which our game design lies. 
%So with that in mind, a game idea will be developed and each element will be justified with a cognitive-flow-concept which it empowers. A list of all major concepts of the game can be found in the following section, \ref{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}. 
%The game idea will then undergo rapid prototyping and testing, and adjustments will be made according to what is \emph{fun} and what is not.  

The main setting for the game is in a post apocalyptic world.
The world has been invaded by an alien race, who wants to exploit the world for resources for their own means.
A few humans remain to fight off the invasion and save the human race.

The player controls a single character of a class of their choosing. The individual classes are explained in more detail in section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:classes}.
The player can move freely within the bounds of the game world.
When killing an enemy, the player will receive experience.
As experience is gained, the player will eventually level up, and be allowed to customize his character by choosing a set of traits. See section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:traits} for a thorough explanation of traits.
The character is equipped with a set of weapons obtained through crafting. See section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:crafting} for more information on crafting.

The players will progress through multiple missions in one single game, each offering waves of enemies to fight.
When a mission goal has been completed, the players can progress to the next mission, which offers new challenges and a faster growing high score. Score is explained in section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:scoring}.

The main goal in the game, is to reach the highest score. \tododaniel{Er the goal ik mere at survive og klarer hele mission?}
This requires each game to be normalized in a manner, such that the maximum reachable score for a mission is independent on the player group.
Players lose by the entire team dying, which is elaborated in more detail in section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:objectives}.
The goal of our game is for the team of players to get as far as possible, without dying.
