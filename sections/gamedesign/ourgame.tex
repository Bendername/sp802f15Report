\section{Our game: GAME\_NAME}\todobenjamin{This name is not ideal.}

Whilst obviously designing a game which is fun, it is important to us that we try to understand the concepts of cognitive flow outlined in \ref{gamedesign:cognitiveflow} such that we have a psychological scientific foundation on which our game design lies. 
So with that in mind, a game idea will be developed and each element will be justified with a cognitive-flow-concept which it empowers. A list of all major concepts of the game can be found in the following section, \ref{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}. 
The game idea will then undergo rapid prototyping and testing, and adjustments will be made according to what is \emph{fun} and what is not.  

\subsection{Main game concepts}\label{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}
There are a few obstacles which has to be addressed in the game design. First of all, the game has to fulfill the initial goals outlined in the problem statement in \ref{sec:motivation}. These could be formalised as such:

\begin{itemize}
\item The game has to have advanced gameplay
\item The game has to have strategical aspects
\item The game has to be multiplayer
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Main goal of the game}
The main goal in the game, is to reach the highest highscore. This requires each level to be somewhat normalized, such that if group x beats the level, they had the same total reachable score as another group. That is, if level one has 10 zombies group x, then level one should contain an obtainable score equalling 10 zombies for group y. The entire score system is explained in \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:scoresystem}. The score is achieved by surviving a wave of enemies or getting as far as you can at a wave.\todoanders{Dennis would you please specific this further not sure I understand completely.} You lose either by the entire team dying, or the monsters killing a special crate of antidotes in the center of your base. Hence the goal is to protect your base, whilst getting as far as you can without dying.
