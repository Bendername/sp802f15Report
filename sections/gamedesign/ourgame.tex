%\subsection{Main game concepts}\label{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}
%Whilst obviously designing a game which is fun, it is important to us that we try to understand the concepts of cognitive flow outlined in \ref{gamedesign:cognitiveflow} such that we have a psychological scientific foundation on which our game design lies. 
%So with that in mind, a game idea will be developed and each element will be justified with a cognitive-flow-concept which it empowers. A list of all major concepts of the game can be found in the following section, \ref{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}. 
%The game idea will then undergo rapid prototyping and testing, and adjustments will be made according to what is \emph{fun} and what is not.  

The main setting for the game is in a post apocalyptic world.
The world has been invaded by an alien race, who's only goal is to exploit the world for resources to their own end. 
A few humans remain to fight off the invasion and save the human race. 

The player controls a single character of a class of their choosing, see section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:classes}. 
This character can move freely in the game world.
When killing an enemy, the player will receive experience.
As experience is gained, the player will eventually level up, and be allowed to customize its character by choosing a set of traits, see section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:traits}.
The character is equipped with a set of weapons obtained through crafting, see section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:crafting}.

The players will progress through multiple missions in one single game, each offering waves of aliens / enemies to fight. 
When a mission goal has been completed, the players can progress to the next mission, which offers new challenges and a faster growing high score, score is explained in section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:scoring}.

The main goal in the game, is to reach the highest score. 
This requires each game to be normalized in a manner, such that the maximum reachable score for a mission is independent on the player group.
The score system is explained in section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:scoring}. 
Players lose either by the entire team dying, this is elaborated in section \ref{gamedesign:ourgame:objectives}. 
Hence the goal is to get as far as you can without dying.
