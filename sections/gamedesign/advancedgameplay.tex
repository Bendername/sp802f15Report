According to Oxford Dictionary gameplay is defined as \textit{''the plot of a computer or video game or the way that it is played''}.
In games such as \textit{Candy Crush} \todoanders{Source here} the gameplay consist of destroying candy by swapping candy to align three pieces of specific candy, this is achieved by swiping the finger across the screen.
This is a very simple gameplay in comparison to games such as \textit{Starcraft} \todoanders{Source needed} which has a lot of controls and a complex plot.
More advanced controls schemes such as the ones you find in \textit{Starcraft} requires many buttons to give the user full control of the game.
This is a problem on mobile devices since the screen is already limited in size, and placing to many buttons will create to much clutter on the small screen.

To reduce the screen clutter a game genre with simpler control scheme will be necessary.
The game should however still have the complex plot to withhold the advanced gameplay.

Many games genres fits into this category therefore the top-down shooter is chosen.
This is chosen because the controls in all basics consist of moving and shooting in a two dimensional space.
Furthermore an RPG elements, such as experience, traits, and classes, should be added to help creating the complex plot.
