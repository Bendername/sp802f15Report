The type of game which must be chosen should satisfy the conditions which was created in section \cite{sec:specifyingtheproblemstatement}.
Summarizing these conditions consisted of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Synchronous multiplayer - Multiple players in the same game, who real-time carry out actions which effect the game
\item Mobile devices - Limited input interface and limited hardware compared to a PC
\item Advanced gameplay - The game should contain a deep plot
\item Complex strategical aspects - Series of meaningful choices which the player/players believe will take the person/persons closer to the goal
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multiplayer Types}
There exist various of games which contains and handles the synchronous multiplayer part differently. Some examples could be massive multiplayer online games, turn based games, or arena games. 


\subsection{Advanced Gameplay}
Advanced gameplay can be achieved through various options. One way of doing is so is by creating a rich interesting story seen in games such as \textit{The Last of Us} \todoanders{Insert source of the Last of us}.
\textit{The Last of Us} allows the player to submerge into a deep story, that is started by a cut scene which sets the setting and mood of the whole game.
This game how ever does not contain very complex strategical aspects, but is more centre

\subsection{Complex Strategical Aspects}
Strategy, as mentioned before, ties closely together with the other keyword because strategy can be connected to many different element. 
Games such as \textit{Candy Crush} has strategic aspect tied to the fact that each move the player makes will cause a series of action in the game.
This series of actions can be somewhat calculated by the player, except for the new tiles which will fall down from above.
Given this calculation the play can make a move which he/she believe will take him closer to winning.
In essence this is not a very deep form of strategy because the player is very limited to the actions he/she can make to achieve the goal.\\
A game like \textit{Dota2}\todoanders{Need source for Dota2 *wink*} also have many random factors but also contains multiple features which all adds to the strategical complexity.
The game consists of two teams of 5 players. They go head to head in a large map, where levelling, selecting skills, buying items to enhance character performance and team work is the main focus. Further there is a massive 110 different heroes, all with 4 different abilities. Each game takes anywhere from twenty minutes to over an hour. 
Strategical aspects involve managing gold-income from player kills, trying to get ahead in levels to become more powerful, and adapting to what the other team does. Further each game starts with a picking phase, where either team take turns to ban heroes and render them not pickable for the game.   
This gives the players a lot of choices which can advance them closer to their goal of winning, and is a good example of a game with a complex strategical aspect.

To satisfy the limitation which comes with the mobile input, a game with a less complicated control scheme is required.
A candidate could be a shooter such as \textit{Counter-Strike}.\todoanders{Need source for CS *wink*}
In \textit{Counter-Strike}two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, consisting of 5 player each go head to head in a first-person shooter combat. The game is round based, and a team can win a round by either killing all other opponents. Further the terrorist team can win by exploding a bomb at designated targets, and the counter-terrorists can win by denying this. Further the game has an economy aspect, you get more money for winning a round, and less money for loosing a round. This money can be spent on weapons of varying strength. 
The first team to get to 16 rounds out of 30 (15 rounds played on both sides) win. 
The strategical aspect of the game is mainly situated around complex player-developed tactics for various levels, weapon composition across the team, and managing economy, without complex control scheme.\\\\
This indicates that a game in the shooter genre would be a good candidate regarding the strategical aspect.
