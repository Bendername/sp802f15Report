The type of game chosen should satisfy the conditions created in section \cite{sec:specifyingtheproblemstatement}.
In summary these conditions consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Synchronous multiplayer - Multiple players in the same game, who in real-time carry out actions which effect the game
\item Mobile devices - The game should run with limited input interface and limited hardware compared to a PC
\item Advanced gameplay - A series of interesting choices
\item Complex strategical aspects - A series of meaningful choices which will take the players closer to the goal
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multiplayer Types}
There exist various games that use synchronous multiplayer and may handle the topic differently. 
Some examples could be massive multiplayer online games in which there are a lot of players gathered on one server.
These players do not necessarily interact with each other but have the possibility to do so, a classic example of this could be \textit{World of Warcraft}\cite{wow}. 
Turn based games is another genre which can contain synchronous multiplayer, games such as \textit{Civilization} and \textit{Hearthstone}\cite{hearthstone} are examples of this. 
%In general multiplayer is applicable to must games, and it adds another level of complexity or redefine it as a whole. %wtf does this even mean

\subsection{Advanced Gameplay \& Complex Strategical Aspects}
The topic of gameplay and strategy are very closely tied, since they both focus on making the player take choices which satisfies the player.

Games such as \textit{Candy Crush}\cite{candycrush} have strategic aspects tied to the fact that each move the player makes will cause a series of actions in the game.
This series of actions is somewhat calculable by the player, except for randomized events such as the new tiles which will fall down from above in \textit{Candy Crush}.
Given this calculation the player can make a move which he/she believes will take him closer to winning.
In essence this is not a very deep form of strategy because the player is very limited to the actions he/she can make to achieve the goal.\\
A game like \textit{Dota 2}\cite{Dota2} also have many random factors but also contains multiple features which all adds to the strategical complexity.
The game consists of two teams of five players each. 
They go head to head in a large map, where levelling, selecting skills and buying items, all to enhance character performance, and team work is the main focus. 
Further there is a massive 110 different heroes, all with at least 4 different abilities. 
Each game takes anywhere from twenty minutes to over an hour. 
Strategical aspects involve managing gold-income from player kills, trying to get ahead in levels to become more powerful, and adapting to what the other team does. 
Further each game starts with a picking phase, where the teams take turns to ban heroes from the game as well as pick the heroes they are going to play with.
This gives the players a lot of choices which can advance them closer to their goal of winning, and is a good example of a game with a complex strategical aspect.

\subsection{Mobile devices}
To satisfy the limitation which comes with the mobile input, a game with a less complicated control scheme is required.
A candidate could be a shooter, an example of which could be \textit{Counter-Strike}. \cite{counterstrike}
In \textit{Counter-Strike}two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, consisting of 5 players each go head to head in a first-person shooter combat. 
The game is round based, and a team can win a round by killing all other opponents. 
Further the terrorist team can win by exploding a bomb at designated targets, and the counter-terrorists can win by denying this. 
Further the game has an economy aspect, you get money for various events such as killing an opponent or winning a round.
Losing a round also grants money, but less than winning.
This money can be spent on weapons of varying strength.
The first team to get to 16 rounds out of 30 (15 rounds played on both sides) win. 
The strategical aspect of the game is mainly situated around complex player-developed tactics for various levels, weapon composition across the team, and managing economy, without complex control scheme.\\\\
This indicates that a game in the shooter genre would be a good candidate regarding the strategical aspect.
