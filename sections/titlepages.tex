}{% the abstract
    We describe which factors are necessary to have in a game that is targeted towards hardcore gamers.
    We develop a game based on these factors, and test it on hardcore players to see if the game caters to them.
    The game is a top-down shooter action strategy game, featuring custom content and networked multiplayer cooperative play.
    The game is developed using Unity3D, and is targeted at mobile devices.
    Furthermore, we describe the choices made throughout the development of the game including artificial intelligence, pathfinding, networking and how to make a control scheme that works from touch devices to keyboard and mouse.
    Performance is also a big part of the development, and the issues which occurred during the development is described, as well as how these were resolved.
