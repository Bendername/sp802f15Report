}{% the abstract
    Casual gamers are prominent on mobile platforms.
    We attempt to develop a game for mobile platforms that cater to hardcore players.
    The game is a action strategy game featuring custom content and networked multiplayer, as well as cross-platform play.
    This report describes the choices made throughout the development of the game.
    Furthermore we test if our game appeals to hardcore players.
