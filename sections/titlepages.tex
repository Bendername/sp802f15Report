}{% the abstract
    We describe what factors are necessary to have in a game that is targeted towards hardcore gamers.
    We develop a game based on these factors and test it on hardcore games to see if it caters to them.
    The game is an action strategy game featuring custom content and networked multiplayer, as well as cross-platform play.
    Furthermore, we describe the choices made throughout the development of the game, the performance issues that occurred during the development, and how these issues were revised.
