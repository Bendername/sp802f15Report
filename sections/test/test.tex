\chapter{Test}
The main goal of the game is to cater for hardcore players, the relevant factors in order to do this are outlined in the table \ref{tab:gamerdedication}.
Therefore will this chapter focus on how to test if this game caters to hardcore players.

\section{Purpose}
The purpose of the test is to discover to which extent the game caters to hardcore players.
This will be done by creating a test which will take the players through the games features which show off all factors which cater \emph{hardcore} gamers, described in section\ref{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}.
This means the player should:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Experience leveling your character
	\item Experience crafting weapons/upgrades
	\item Experience an objective
	\item Kill some aliens
	\item Playing with multiple classes on the team
\end{itemize}
The player will however not try to create their own mission packs.

\section{User Profile}
The users for this test will be hardcore players.
To find the test subjects a preliminary survey has been made to determine whether or not the player is hardcore.
The survey will more specifically determine the players \textit{Gamer Dedication Score} which is based on the Gamasutra article\cite{casual_vs_hardcore} outlined in motivation, Section \ref{sec:motivation}.
All the factors from the article has been turned into questions, as even the ones we cannot affect during game design are relevant to classify players.
For each question, 5 answers exist ranging from \textit{"I strongly disagree"} to \textit{"I strongly agree"}.

The answers are then used to evaluate Equation \ref{eq:GD} in order to determine a \emph{gamer dedication score}.
The goal is to find a group of \emph{hardcore} players or \emph{ultra hardcore} players to use for the test.
The full survey and the complete results can be found in Appendix \ref{app:survey}.

\section{Context, Equipment \& Setup}
The test will take place in one of the group rooms of Cassiopeia.
A test will consist a team of players, which will be three to four of the players, which was found to be hardcore players in the survey.
The players will be equipped with three mobile devices and a computer with a game-pad connected.

\subsection{Mission}
The game will be equipped with a premade mission pack that is designed to allow a realistic game session in the completed game.
The mission pack consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 2 missions
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 2 waves - Each wave will introducing a new enemy each wave
		\item 3 waves - The first two waves will introduce new enemies and the last wave will introduce a boss
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
The mission should furthermore enable all the players to get enough resources to try out different weapons and their upgrades.

\section{Tasks}
To show the players the features the following tasks should be done:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Players starts by joining a game lobby together
\item Player then should select their favoured class
\item The host will then start the game
\item The players should then try and complete the mission pack
\end{enumerate}
If the team should fail to mission pack, they should try again but have time to discuss strategy.

\section{Post-play questionnaire}
