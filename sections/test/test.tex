\chapter{Test}
With the relevant factors for catering to hardcore games listed in Table \ref{tab:gamerdedication}, we decided to test whether the game caters to hardcore players.
In order to do this, a survey is made to determine the \emph{gamer dedication score} of subjects, in order to find two groups of four\todobenjamin{eller hvor mange vi nu finder} subjects, consisting of \emph{casual} and \emph{hardcore} players respectively.

Each group will then play the game together in our test mission pack, and after each mission, they will rate their level of enjoyment for that mission.
Some missions will induce a larger level of stress than others.
If the game succeeds in catering to hardcore players, those players should enjoy the game more than the casual players.
