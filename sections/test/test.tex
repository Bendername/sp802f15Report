\chapter{Test}
The main goal of the game is to cater for hardcore players, the relevant factors in order to do this are outlined in the table \ref{tab:gamerdedication}.
The purpose of the test is to discover to which extent the game caters to hardcore players.

In order to do this, a preliminary survey has been made to determine the \emph{gamer dedication score} of the testers.
The survey is based on the Gamasutra article\cite{casual_vs_hardcore} outlined in motivation, section \ref{sec:motivation}.
All the factors has been turned into questions, as even the ones we cannot affect during game design are relevant to classify players.
For each question, 5 options exist ranging from \textit{"I strongly disagree"} to \textit{"I strongly agree"}.

The answers weight is then calculated as per equation \ref{eq:GD}.
The goal is to find two groups of players to test with, \emph{casual players} and \emph{hardcore players}.
A full review of the survey and the complete results can be found in appendix \ref{app:survey}.

\subsection*{The test-mission}
The game mission created for the test session is designed to allow a realistic game session in the completed game.
It should show off all factors which have an impact on the factors which caters hardcore gamers, described in section\ref{gamedesign:maingameconcepts}.

As such the mission consists of:

\begin{itemize}
\item 4 waves - \emph{3 waves of increasingly hard enemies, and the fourth wave being a boss}
\item Experience leveling your character
\item Experience crafting weapons/upgrades
\item Experience an objective
\item Playing with multiple classes on the team
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Post-play questionnaire}
A post-game survey is taken by the test-persons in order to determine to which extent they enjoy the concepts that has been designed to facilitate the gameplay catering to hardcore players.
For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{The concept of waves is fun}
\item \emph{The concept of objectives which yield rewards is fun}
\item \emph{The concept of player classes is fun}
\end{itemize}

Each question will be rated from 1-5, where 1 is \emph{not fun at all} and 5 is \emph{very fun}.
In addition, the people surveyed will have the option to write a comment for each of their answers to elaborate on why they selected that answer.
The full questionnaire can be found in \ref{app:postgamesurvey}.
