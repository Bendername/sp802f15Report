\section{Game idea}
The players are stranded in an abandoned and torn-down house, surrounded by enemies. The players must fend for their survival using guns, explosives and constructions such as turrets and barricades. The enemies randomly drop loot which contains resources which can be spend in later.\\\\
After defeating a wave of enemies, the players must build defensive structures and/or upgrade weapons in order to prepare for the next wave of enemies.\\\\
This gives a two phased game:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Phase / Night: (Long duration, main phase)

\begin{itemize}
\item Defend yourself by shooting the enemies
\item Collect resources which drops from dead enemies
\end{itemize}

\item Phase / Day: (Short duration, planning phase)

\begin{itemize}
\item Craft and place offensive and/or defensive structures
\item Craft weapons
\item Upgrade weapons 
\item Upgrade structures 

\end{itemize}	
\end{enumerate}
