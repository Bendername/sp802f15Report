\chapter{Introduction and Motivation}
Presently the most played category of games for mobile devices is casual games.
According to ESA\cite{ESA}\cite{ESApdf} (\textit{Entertainment Software Association}), 46\% of the mobile gamers play casual games, not including the 31\% that play a combination of puzzle-, board-, game show-, trivia- and card-games.
However when talking about games on other platforms the distribution is widely different where only 2.3\% of the games sold are casual\cite{ESApdf}.
Where as more of the "hardcore" genres such as  action, strategy, sports games, shooters, roleplay, racing, and adventure fills 86.5\% of the market\cite{ESApdf}.
It could therefore be interesting to look at the players who do not play these casual games and create a game that they would play on mobile devices.
