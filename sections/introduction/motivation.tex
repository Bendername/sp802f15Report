Nowadays the largest category of games for mobile devices is casual games. According to ESA\cite{ESA}\cite{ESApdf} (\textit{Entertainment Software Association}) 46\% of the mobile gamers play casual games and 31\% plays a combination of puzzle-, board-, game show-, trivia- and card-games. 
According to Googles PlayStore \cite{googleplay} and Apples AppStore\cite{appstore}, games like \textit{Candy Crush}, \textit{Hay day}, \textit{Clash of Clans}, \textit{Subway surfers} and \textit{1010! Puzzle} falls into these categories.\\

These casual games all have a short game session time span. Further, they contain a \textit{progression system} and/or a \textit{high score system}. The main focus is to foster these two systems and becomming the best on the leaderboards. The games' multiplayer aspects are asynchronous and mainly sorrounding sharing your achievements, sharing items or otherwise participate in segregated multiplayer experiences.\\

There, of course, exist real-time synchronous multiplayer mobile games such as \textit{GunBros 2} and \textit{Angry Birds Go!}. These games are however, designed as casual games. That is, they are to be played whenever you want in short bursts, utilizing the short play sessions, and secondly they are to be played many times utilizing the progression system.\\

The game design of casual games are often the complete opposite design of the games you see on PC and consoles, discounting Facebook and similar platforms for casual games. The traditional PC/console games are normally more advanced, features deep and rich game play and stories, with advanced controls and expect the player to spend a reasonable amount of time on a game session. This leads to the question:
\begin{center}
\textit{What is required to create a synchronous multiplayer game for mobile devices, which contains both advanced gameplay mechanics and more complex strategical aspects compared to the common games developed for mobile devices?}

%One thing that goes across most games on the mobile platform, is the control scheme. They are usually very simple and very sparse, featuring only one or two input types such as swipe and tap. Looking at the pc games they utilize a wide array of buttons on the keyboard, along with a multitude of buttons on modern mice or a controller. There is an apparent problem in designing a controlscheme for mobile devices, which allows for a more advanced gameplay, whilst still giving the player all the control and feedback he wants.\tododennis{Det her afsnit er den st√∏rste poop}

%As mentioned before, the average play session for mobile games are not very long. According to \textit{Statista}\cite{statista} the average session for an \textit{iPad} game is \textit{6.8 minutes}\cite{statistaaverageappsession}, while a top AAA PC/console game like \textit{Assasin's Creed 4: Black flag} can reach upwards of \textit{3.14 hours}\cite{statistalongestsession} long average play sessions. 
%It is therefore important to create an appealing gameplay which will encourage and draw the player to have longer play sessions than the average mobile game.
%According to ESA the best selling video games are \textit{action} games followed by \textit{shooters}. It would therefore be interesting to create such a game for the mobile devices to help creating a appealing game.
