\section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivation}
Presently the most played category of games for mobile devices is casual games.
According to ESA\cite{ESA}\cite{ESApdf} (\textit{Entertainment Software Association}), 46\% of the mobile gamers play casual games, not including the 31\% that play a combination of puzzle-, board-, game show-, trivia- and card-games.

But what is a casual game exactly?
Casual games are games that cater to casual gamers.
In an article from Gamasutra, a proposed way to measure the \textit{casualness} of a player is through a questionaire concerning 15 factors\cite{casual_vs_hardcore}.
These 15 factors and their weight according to Gamasutra can be seen in Table \ref{tab:gamerdedication}\cite{casual_vs_hardcore}.
For each factor, a player can answer a number from 1 to 5, where 1 means he thinks the factor doesn't fit him, and a 5 meaning he thinks the factor fits himi very well.
Through these numbers, a \emph{Gamer Dedication Score} or \emph{GD} can be calculated using Equation \ref{eq:GD} where $w$ is the weight, $s$ is the score and $n$ is 15 (because there is 15 factors).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:GD}
GD = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^n w_j s_j}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^n 5 w_j}
\end{equation}

The result is a percentage that through Table \ref{tab:gamertype} can be used to determine the type of gamer the player is\cite{casual_vs_hardcore}.
Not all of these factors can be directly influenced when designing a game, and not all of them are relevant when designing our game.

Below we list the factors mentioned in the article from Gamasutra, as well as mentioning whether a particular factor is relevant in our case:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Playing games over many long sessions.}
The game can encourage the player to play longer through reward or progress, therefore it is relevant.

\item \emph{Discussing games with friends/bulletin boards.}
We have no intention of creating a bulletin board or chat-system within our game, and therefore we deem this an irrelevant factor.

\item \emph{Having comparative knowledge of the industry.}
Knowledge of the industry happens outside of the game, therefore it is irrelevant.

\item \emph{Being tolerant of frustration.}
The game can increase in difficulty to increase frustration levels, therefore it is relevant.

\item \emph{Showing early adoption behaviour.}
Early adoption behaviour happens before the game is played, therefore it is irrelevant.

\item \emph{Desiring to modify or extend games in a creative way.}
The game engine can be made with modification or extension in mind, allowing for players to create their own content or features, therefore it is relevant.

\item \emph{Having technological savvy.}
Technological savvy is used to access the game, once it is accessed it is up to the game to be user friendly, therefore it is irrelevant.

\item \emph{Having the latest high-end computers/consoles.}
Since we are developing for mobile platforms, and they generally have low-end hardware, this is irrelevant.

\item \emph{Playing for the exhilaration of defeating (or completing) the game.}
The game can offer the player a reward for completing the game, therefore it is relevant.

\item \emph{Hungering for gaming-related information.}
Gathering information about the gaming world happens outside of the game, therefore it is irrelevant.

\item \emph{Being engaged in competition with oneself, the game and other players.}
The game can provide the player with the ability to challenge other players through various means. Therefore this is relevant.

\item \emph{Being willing to pay for the game.}
Since the game we are developing is a university project it will be free, so this is not relevant.

\item \emph{Preferring games that have depth and complexity.}
The game can directly cater to this preferrence by having deep and complex gameplay, therefore this is relevant.

\item \emph{Time started playing games relative to the age of the industry.}
The game cannot affect this, therefore it is not relevant.

\item \emph{Preferring violent/action games.}
Theming the game as a violent action game will cater to this preferences, therefore it is relevant.
\end{enumerate}

The relevant factors are then taken into consideration when designing our game.
