\section{Motivation}
The motivation for this project is to create a mobile game which can be enjoyed together with friends.\\\\
Many of the popular games which you see for mobile today is casual games, which is not very multiplayer oriented and mostly consist of sharing of high score, giving each other in-game presents and so forth.
Therefore the game should be a direct connected multiplayer.\\\\
We want the game to be a more complex action 2D shooting game which opens for good cooperation opportunities against the computer.

Since shooting games normally requires good precision when aiming at targets and since the touch interface on mobile devices does not give tactile feedback it would not be ideal. Therefore the game should have a feature which enable the user to play with a gamepad, but it should also be controllable with a pure touch interface.\\\\
This description gives a task list which should be considered when the game will be designed:
\begin{itemize}
\item What networking model will suit best?
\item Implementation of the gamepad
\item How should the touch interface be designed to handle a complex game? 
\end{itemize}
