\section{Target Audience Analysis} \label{sec:motivation}

How do we determine if a particular gamer is hardcore or casual in regards to the games played?
In an article from Gamasutra, a proposed way to measure how \textit{casual} or \textit{hardcore} a gamer is, is through a questionnaire concerning 15 factors\cite{casual_vs_hardcore}.
These 15 factors and their weight according to Gamasutra can be seen in Table \ref{tab:gamerdedication}\cite{casual_vs_hardcore}.
For each factor, a gamer can answer a number from 1 to 5, where 1 means he thinks the factor does not fit him, and a 5 meaning he thinks the factor fits him very well.
Using the factors, a \emph{Gamer Dedication Score} or \emph{GD} can be calculated using Equation \ref{eq:GD} where $w$ is the weight, $s$ is the score and $n$ is 15 (because there are 15 factors).

\begin{equation}\label{eq:GD}
GD = \frac{\sum\limits_{j=1}^n w_j s_j}{\sum\limits_{j=1}^n 5 w_j}
\end{equation}

The result is a percentage that through Table \ref{tab:gamertype} can be used to determine the type of a gamer a person is\cite{casual_vs_hardcore}.
Not all of these factors can be directly influenced when designing a game, and not all of them are relevant when designing our game.

Below we list the factors mentioned in the article from Gamasutra, as well as shortly mentioning whether we find a particular factor relevant in our case, when designing our game:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Playing games over many long sessions.}
The game should encourage the gamer to play longer through reward or progress, therefore it is relevant.

\item \emph{Discussing games with friends/bulletin boards.}
The game should encourage gamers to discuss the game outside the boundaries of the game itself, such as on forums.
Creating an in-game bulletin board or forum is outside the scope of this project, as we focus on creating the game itself.
This item is therefore deemed irrelevant.

\item \emph{Having comparative knowledge of the industry.}
Hardcore gamers tend to show greater knowledge of the gaming industry than more casual gamers.
Knowledge of the industry happens outside of a game and is not easily affected by the game itself.
We deem it irrelevant in our case.

\item \emph{Being tolerant of frustration.}
Hardcore gamers tend to be more tolerant to games of higher difficulty.
While \textit{higher difficulty} is subjective, one can affect this factor by adjusting the difficulty of the game.
We find it relevant.

\item \emph{Showing early adoption behavior.}
While hardcore gamers tend to be \textit{early adopters}, it is not a factor that can be influenced by a game itself.
We find it irrelevant in our case.

\item \emph{Desiring to modify or extend games in a creative way.}
The game engine can be made with modification or extension in mind, allowing players to create their own content or features, therefore it is relevant.

\item \emph{Having technological savvy.}
Technological savvy is used to access the game, once it is accessed it is up to the game to be user friendly, therefore it is irrelevant.

\item \emph{Having the latest high-end computers/consoles.}
As we are developing for mobile platforms, and have access to mid to high-end mobile devices, we deem this relevant.

\item \emph{Playing for the exhilaration of defeating (or completing) the game.}
The game can offer the player a reward for completing the game, therefore it is relevant.

\item \emph{Hungering for gaming-related information.}
Gathering information about the gaming world happens outside of the game, therefore it is irrelevant.

\item \emph{Being engaged in competition with oneself, the game, and other players.}
The game can provide the player with the ability to challenge other players through various means.
Therefore this is relevant.

\item \emph{Being willing to pay for the game.}
Since the game we are developing is a university project it will be free, so this is not relevant.

\item \emph{Preferring games that have depth and complexity.}
The game can directly cater to this preference by having deep and complex gameplay, therefore this is relevant.

\item \emph{Time started playing games relative to the age of the industry.}
The game cannot affect this, therefore it is not relevant.

\item \emph{Preferring violent/action games.}
Theming the game as a violent action game will cater to this preferences, therefore it is relevant.
\end{enumerate}

The relevant factors are then taken into consideration when designing our game.
