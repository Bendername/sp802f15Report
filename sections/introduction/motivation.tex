Nowadays the largest category of games for mobile devices is casual games. According to ESA\cite{ESA}\cite{ESApdf}
(\textit{Entertainment Software Association}), 46\% of the mobile gamers play casual games and 31\% plays a combination
of puzzle-, board-, game show-, trivia- and card-games.  According to Google's PlayStore \cite{googleplay} and Apple's
App Store\cite{appstore}, games like \textit{Candy Crush}, \textit{Hay day}, \textit{Clash of Clans}, \textit{Subway
Surfers} and \textit{1010! Puzzle} fall into those categories.\\

Common for casual games is a short game-session time span and often some kind of \textit{progression system} and/or
a \textit{high score system}. The main focus is to foster these two systems and become the best on the leaderboards.
The multiplayer aspects are asynchronous and mainly sharing your achievements, sharing items or otherwise participating
in segregated multiplayer experiences.\\

Synchronous multiplayer mobile games do exist, such as \textit{GunBros 2} and \textit{Angry Birds Go!}, but such games
are often designed around the same casual game concepts as described above. That is, they are to be played whenever
you want in short bursts, utilizing the short play-sessions, and secondly they are to be played many times utilizing
the progression system.\\

The game design of casual games are often the opposite of games designed for PC and consoles, discounting Facebook
and similar platforms for casual games. The traditional PC/console games are normally games with more advanced controls
and expect the player to spend a reasonable amount of time on a game-session. This leads to the question:
\begin{center}\label{intro:problem_statement}
\textit{What is required to create a synchronous multiplayer game for mobile devices, which contains both advanced
gameplay and more complex strategical aspects for a mobile device?}
\end{center}

To help answer this question 

%One thing that goes across most games on the mobile platform, is the control scheme. They are usually very simple and very sparse, featuring only one or two input types such as swipe and tap. Looking at the pc games they utilize a wide array of buttons on the keyboard, along with a multitude of buttons on modern mice or a controller. There is an apparent problem in designing a controlscheme for mobile devices, which allows for a more advanced gameplay, whilst still giving the player all the control and feedback he wants.\tododennis{Det her afsnit er den st√∏rste poop}

%As mentioned before, the average play session for mobile games are not very long. According to \textit{Statista}\cite{statista} the average session for an \textit{iPad} game is \textit{6.8 minutes}\cite{statistaaverageappsession}, while a top AAA PC/console game like \textit{Assasin's Creed 4: Black flag} can reach upwards of \textit{3.14 hours}\cite{statistalongestsession} long average play sessions. 
%It is therefore important to create an appealing gameplay which will encourage and draw the player to have longer play sessions than the average mobile game.
%According to ESA the best selling video games are \textit{action} games followed by \textit{shooters}. It would therefore be interesting to create such a game for the mobile devices to help creating a appealing game.
