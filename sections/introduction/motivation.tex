\section{Motivation} \label{sec:motivation}
Nowadays popular mobile games consists of mostly casual games. According to ESA\cite{ESA}\cite{ESApdf} (\textit{Entertainment Software Association}) 46\% of the mobile gamers play casual games and 31\% plays Puzzle, Board Game, Game Show, Trivia, Card Games, these games are according to Google Play\cite{googleplay} and AppStore\cite{appstore} games like \textit{Candy Crush}, \textit{Hay day}, \textit{Clash of Clans}, \textit{Subway surfers}, \textit{1010! Puzzle} etc.\\
All of these casual games have small game sessions and some sort of progression and/or high score system attach to them, but none of these contains a synchronous multiplayer game mode but are mostly about setting high scores, sharing items or an asynchronous multiplayer game mode.
There, of course, exist real-time synchronous mobile games containing synchronous multiplayer such as \textit{GunBros 2} and \textit{Angry Birds Go!}, but these games are designed, as all the other casual games, to be played whenever you want, given the short play sessions and often how much you want given the progression system.\\
This is to an extend opposite of the games that exists on PCs/Consoles, given these are normally more advanced and deep games with advanced controls which depends on you having a certain span of time allocated to do a game session. 
This brings up the question \textit{"What is required to create a playable synchronous multiplayer game for a mobile devices which contains both advanced game mechanics and deeper strategical aspects?"}\\\\
One of the things the popular mobile games have in common is the controls, these are very simple and often only include one to two input types, such as swipe and tap. These kind of mobile controls are in general not feasible for the advanced PC/Console games since they requires many of buttons and different inputs to control the game. A sophisticated control scheme is therefore required in order to ensure the play is able to play the game properly. 

As mentioned before the average game session for mobile game is not very long. According to \textit{Statista}\cite{statista} the average game session for an \textit{iPad} game is 6.8 minutes\cite{statistaaverageappsession} while the top PC/console games can reach up to a 3.14 hours\cite{statistalongestsession} long average game session (Assasin's Creed 4: Black flag) 
It is therefore important to create an appealing game play which will encourage the player to have longer play sessions then the average mobile game.
According to ESA the best selling video games are \textit{action} games followed by \textit{shooters}. It would therefore be interesting to create such a game for the mobile devices to help creating a appealing game.
