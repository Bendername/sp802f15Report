In this section we will discuss the user experience of our game, the performance issues encountered, as well the extend of our extensible system.

\subsection{User Experience}
As shown in the user test of the game(section \ref{test:results}) we had mostly positive feedback in terms of the gameplay and features of the game.
Most users took the game as an early beta, and accepted the limited content and the fact that they were testing the early stages of a game.

One thing to note, however, is that the test group was instructed in the contents of the game before actually playing it. 
This is of course because the focus has been on the actual technical part of the game, and not so much the user interface part.
It has also came to show by some users who were not aware that objectives actually existed in the game.
This is obviously a problem because it is a concept, which serves to make the game cater to hardcore players, and if we cannot communicate this, the game will not be as interesting as it could have been for our target group.

\subsection{Performance}

\subsection{Extensibility}
Creating a game from a programming perspective is not only about manufacturing the game itself, but also about making the systems that facilitate the creation of the game.
The game developed is more so a tech demo than a fully fledged game in terms of added content.
In most cases it is trivial to extend the content of the game. 
As such the game is not at all complete in terms of content, but it is very strong in terms of the framework and architecture in place to cater for the goals we set out to meet, i.e. making a game for hardcore players.

\subsubsection{Traits}\label{dicsussion:traits}
The trait system is used to create traits that the player receive upon leveling up.
Due to the flexibility of our trait system, see section \ref{sec:modules:traits}, it is trivial to add more \emph{traits} to the game, which manipulate any given attribute in the game, be it damage, movement speed or adding an entirely new effect. 

Character classes are also differentiated by their individual abilities.
Mendy is a healer, because she has a \emph{healing} ability.
These are also defined in the trait system.
As such it is also trivial to add more classes or differentiate the ones already added, if that is desirable.

\subsubsection{Missions}\label{dicsussion:missions}
For creating missions, maps and waves the mission system is used.
The system relies on .png files used to generate the map, and .json files to define the missions and waves, as well as which enemies and objectives encountered in these.
Using these ubiquitous formats, we have been able to open up these systems, so that users may create custom content.
The .json files, while human readable, tends to become large and thus hard to comprehend.
In addition to this, its precise functionality and syntax is vague without knowing the internal representation.
As a result, the user may find it difficult to create valid content that can be loaded into the game.

In addition, the missions have support for \textit{MissionObjectives}, see figure \ref{fig:json_chart}, which are currently not implemented into the game.

%\subsection{DO NOT READ BELOW THIS}

%
%This has also been the case with our game.
%The current framework supports an advanced set of mechanics; the trait system is the basis of all character customization, be it player based or enemy based.
%As such, it is easy to develop new types of player classes or enemies with certain abilities, it is merely a question of creating more effects, wrapping them up in a trait, and adding them to a player class or enemy.
%Our mission system is also extensible.
%It is possible to create custom missions with a set of waves, enemies and objectives.
%The system is made such that it is easy to make new and interesting missions which can cater to different types of players. 

%Another place for improvement is performance.
%It is a tall order to have a large environment with hordes of intelligent enemies, and on top of that have it run smoothly on mobile devices.
%In order to have the game contain more stress points, it is essential that the game supports many types of enemies with many types of attack strategies.
%In order to do this, one could have more agent states in the enemies, making sure that resources are only spent when they are directly interacting with a player.
%This has already been done to some extent, but could be optimized even further.


%Exntensibility:
%	Trait system
%	Mission System
%	GUI/tools for custom content

%Performance
%	AI/Enemies
%	Networking
%		server does everything \& mobile being server

%UX Daniel - 
%	GUI is shoit
