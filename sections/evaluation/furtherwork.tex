As such, a major part of what could be improved in the future, would be to create all this content that the game architecture allows.
It is the creation of content that makes a game stand out and shine in terms of fun and immersion and while our architecture allows for this, the primary focus has been creating the architecture over the content. 

In addition, the tools themselves can also be extended further.
This would mean adding support for custom unit types, texture packs, and objectives.

It is currently only possible to play the game in a local area network.
Further work would involve making the game playable over the Internet, rather than local net only.
