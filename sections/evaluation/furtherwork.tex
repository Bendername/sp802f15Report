Creating a game from a programming perspective is not only about manufacturing the game itself, but also about making the tools that facilitate the creation of the game.
This has also been the case with our game.
The current framework supports an advanced set of mechanics; the trait system is the basis of all character customization, be it player based or enemy based.
As such, it is easy to develop new types of player classes or enemies with certain abilities, it is merely a question of creating more effects, wrapping them up in a trait, and adding them to a player class or enemy.
Our mission system is also extensible.
It is possible to create custom missions with a set of waves, enemies and objectives.
The system is made such that it is easy to make new and interesting missions which can cater to different types of players. 

As such, a major part of what could be improved in the future, would be to create all this content that the game architecture allows.
It is the creation of content that makes a game stand out and shine in terms of fun and immersion and while our architecture allows for this, the primary focus has been creating the architecture over the content. 

In addition, the tools themselves can also be extended further.
This would mean adding support for custom unit types, texture packs, and objectives.

Another place for improvement is performance.
It is a high order to have a large environment with hordes of intelligent enemies, and on top of that have it run smoothly on mobile devices.
In order to make the game have more stress points, it is essential that the game supports many types of enemies with many types of attack strategies.
In order to do this, one could have more agent states in the enemies, making sure that resources are only spent when they are directly interacting with a player.
This has already been done to some extent, but could be optimized even further.

It is currently only possible to play the game over local area network.
For any multiplayer game to be playable in a real world setting, it would have to be networked over the Internet, rather than local net only.
