\chapter{Evaluation}
This chapter will reflect over the project as a whole. It will take a look at how the problem statement was fulfilled, and where it was lacking. We will look at the problems which arose, how they were solved and which could not be solved. Further we will take a look at what could be done with more time, as well as a quick overview of the work process during the development of the game and this report.
