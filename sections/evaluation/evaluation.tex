\chapter{Evaluation}
This chapter will reflect over the project as a whole. In it, we look at how the problem statement was fulfilled, and where it was lacking. We will look at problems which arose, how they were solved and problems we did not solve in due time. Further we will take a look at what could be done with more time, as well as a quick overview of the work process during the development of the game and this report.
